### Triadic Color Schemes

Triadic color schemes, much like complementary schemes, provide additional pops of color while allowing for some flexibility in the range you can use.

These consist of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel.

For instance, if we stick with blue being our main color, we would then select red-orange and yellow-green as the pairing combinations. This creates a triangle of colors within the color wheel and gives us a wider palette to choose from.

Triadic color schemes are useful in that they create a sense of equality, vibrancy, and security in your designs.
